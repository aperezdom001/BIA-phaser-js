Capstone Project: SURVIVOR

*Introduction*

In this capstone project I wanted to highlight one of the aspects I want to 
to be highlight and the career I want to be involved in the future as an artist
and software engineer: Game Design and Development.

Inspired by the Netflix documentary, “Rompan Todo” (“Break It All”), my game will have the user go through a unique experience involving the subject of music. “Rompan Todo” is about the history of Latin American rock from the 1950s to present day involving many musicians who influenced/or have been influenced by this history. One of the parts in this documentary that shocked me was how powerful political figures and high-class people were threatened by rock because it was a way for people to voice out their identity, truth, and freedom. This fact has helped me visualize what basic game 
mechanics I want to include in my game. 

Instructions:

 - Use the AWD keys to navigate your way through the platform and collect the voices. 
 - Each time a voice is collected, an enemy (someone of higher power like in the documentary) will descend down and bounce
 - Collect as many voices as you can or the game is over!!
